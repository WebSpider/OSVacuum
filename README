Welcome to the repository for open source vacuuming!

Here all the electronics, firmware and other designs are joined, resulting in a
fully operational vacuuming robot, as an alternative to the commercial versions
out there

Main advantages ?

- Versatility: Changes in behaviour are easy to implement
- Cost: We hope to have a cheaper deisn than current commercial versions at some point :-)

Initial directory layout

/electronics    - Contains all that has to do with electronics, PCBs, components
/firmware       - All the programming for electronics
/design         - All the design files for casings etc (TODO)
